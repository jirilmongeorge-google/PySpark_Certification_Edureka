The code implements  data wrangling and classification techniques (i.e. logistic regression analysis) to build a process that recognises whether a certain email is spam or not. Alternative specifications of the classification technique used are explored to assess the performance and efficiency of the process._"

A potential interpretation of this effect is that stopwords may be carrying information about the writing style of the texts, which is indicative of whether they are spam or not; and (iii) For a given vector size N, processing a lemmatised corpus yields fairly similar testing accuracy to processing an unprocessed corpus."
